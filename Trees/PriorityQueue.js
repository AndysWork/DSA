/* 
Priority Queue is a data structure where each element has a priority. 
Elements with higher priorities are served before elements with lower priorities.

Attributes:
- Priority: The importance of an element.
- Priority Queue is an abstract data type.
- Priority Queue is not a binary heap.
- Priority Queue is not a binary search tree.

Where to use:
- When you need to process elements based on their priority.
- When you need to process elements in a specific order.
- When you need to process elements with higher priority first.
- When you need to process elements with lower priority first.

Real life use cases:
- Operating Systems
- Networking
- Discrete Event Simulation
- Huffman Coding
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- A* Search Algorithm
