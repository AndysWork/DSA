Domain Specific Questions
With smaller companies, you may encounter more domain specific questions when it comes to coding interviews.
What does this mean? It means that the questions focus less on computer science fundamentals like 
Data Structures and Algorithms, and instead they focus on the technology stack that the company is 
actively working with. To practice these questions, I have listed a great list for you to go through 
based on what type of job you are applying to (React developer, Mobile developer, etc...):
