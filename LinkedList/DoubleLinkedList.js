/*
1. DoubleLinkedList - A linked list in which each node keeps a reference to the node before and after it.
when we want to insert a new node in the middle of the list, we can do it in O(1) time.
2. Attributes:
head: The first node in the list
tail: The last node in the list
length: The number of nodes in the list
3. Methods:
append(value): Add a new node to the end of the list
prepend(value): Add a new node to the beginning of the list
insert(index, value): Add a new node at the specified index
remove(index): Remove the node at the specified index
4. When to Use Double Linked Lists:
When you need to add or remove nodes frequently
When you need to traverse the list in both directions
When you need to access the previous node of a node
