/* 
1. Description - Trees are a type of data structure that are used to store elements in a hierarchical manner.
A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges.
Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a child node.
The first node of the tree is called the root node.
The last node of the tree is called the leaf node.
The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
The depth of a node is the length of the path from the root node to that node.
The depth of the root node is 0.
The level of a node is the depth of the node + 1.
The height of a tree with a single node is 0.
The height of an empty tree is -1.
The height of a tree is the height of the root node.

2. Where to use Trees?
    1. To represent hierarchical data.
    2. To store data in a way that makes it easy to search, insert, and delete.
    3. To represent sorted lists.
    4. To create decision trees.
    5. To create parse trees.
    6. To create expression trees.
    7. To create binary search trees.
    8. To create balanced trees.
3. Types of Trees:
    1. Binary Tree
    2. Binary Search Tree
    3. AVL Tree
    4. Red-Black Tree
    5. B-Tree
    6. B+ Tree
    7. Splay Tree
    8. Segment Tree
    9. Trie
    10. Suffix Tree
    11. Huffman Tree
    12. Fenwick Tree
    13. Binary Indexed Tree
    14. Quad Tree
    15. Octree
    16. KD Tree

4. Pros:
    1. Trees are flexible and can be used to represent any type of data.
    2. Trees are efficient for searching, inserting, and deleting elements.
    3. Trees can be used to represent sorted lists.
    4. Trees can be used to create decision trees.
5. Cons:
    1. Trees require more memory than arrays and linked lists.
    2. Trees can be difficult to implement and maintain.
    3. Trees can be slow for some operations.
6. Time Complexity:
    1. Searching: O(log n)
    2. Insertion: O(log n)
    3. Deletion: O(log n)
    4. Traversal: O(n)
7. Space Complexity:
    1. O(n)
8. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a tree representation of 
   the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language.
